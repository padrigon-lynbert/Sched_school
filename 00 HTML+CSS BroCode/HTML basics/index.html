            [Verse 1]

            Slow down, you crazy child
            You're so ambitious for a juvenile
            But then if you're so smart
            Tell me why are you still so afraid? Mm
            Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
            You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
            You've got so much to do
            And only so many hours in a day, hey

            
            [Chorus]

            But you know that when the truth is told
            That you can get what you want or you can just get old
            You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
            When will you realize Vienna waits for you?


            [Verse 2]

            Slow down, you're doin' fine
            You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
            Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
            Too bad, but it's the life you lead
            You're so ahead of yourself, that you forgot what you need
            Though you can see when you're wrong
            You know you can't always see when you're right
            You're right


            [Outro]

            And you know that when the truth is told
            That you can get what you want or you could just get old
            You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
            Why don't you realize Vienna waits for you?
            When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
